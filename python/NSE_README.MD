Data Source: Yahoo Finance
Historical Data is 100% correct with respect to Yahoo Finance Records.
99% companies data is complete.
A few companies(+-1%) data is not fully complete but accurate [eg 1 record only] ('CONFIPET', 'DEEPENR', 'EMAMIPAP')

Why not fully complete?
Because it is not available on YAHOO FINANCE in NSE. For instance for CONFINET we have a single record only(see link https://in.finance.yahoo.com/quote/CONFIPET.NS/history?p=CONFIPET.NS&.tsrc=fin-srch)
